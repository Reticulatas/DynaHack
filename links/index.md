## UnNetHack

DynaHack owes much of its gameplay to UnNetHack, a long-running NetHack variant that features more randomness, more levels, more challenges and more fun than vanilla NetHack; in a nutshell, "How NetHack would look today if the DevTeam didn't stop releasing", following a modern open source project approach of development.

UnNetHack has continued development independently of DynaHack, and thus has even more new gameplay to discover that does not exist in DynaHack.

## NetHack 4

NetHack 4 is a NetHack variant focused on adding modern features to NetHack without making large changes to its core gameplay.

Like DynaHack, NetHack 4 was originally based on NitroHack, an earlier attempt to modernize NetHack, and as such shares a similar interface style with DynaHack.  With modernization as its focus, the interface of NetHack 4 is even further developed than DynaHack's, most notably including graphical tiles and a consistent look-and-feel across operating systems.

## dNetHack

dNetHack is a bold NetHack variant that makes many large changes to the gameplay and content of NetHack:

* Greatly expands and enhances on the races and roles.
  * The new Binder role performs rituals to bind to spirits that grant skills and offer powerful new abilities.
* Completely rearranges and expands the dungeon.
* Adds many new and powerful artifacts, spread out over more weapon, armor and item types.
* Adds many more items and monsters to the game.
  * Elbereth engraving is replaced by an intricate system of wards that are learned gradually throughout the game.
  * Intrinsic resistances gained from eating corpses are temporary instead of permanent.
* And much, much more...
