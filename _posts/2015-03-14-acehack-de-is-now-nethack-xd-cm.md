`acehack.de`, the server hosting NAOHack and several NetHack variants for online play, has changed hosting and is now [`nethack.xd.cm`][nethack-xd-cm], with the following changes:

* [AceHack][acehack] is no longer offered for online play.
* LeakHack (the [leaked post-3.4.3 version of official NetHack][leakhack]) is also no longer available, though its source code is still available at the new website.
* The in-browser web terminal (wstty) is no longer available, so you'll need a dedicated SSH client like [PuTTY][putty] to watch or play.

The [Links page][links] has been updated accordingly.
