After a very long period of DynaHack-related inactivity, this website has finally become structured the way I wanted it all along.

The old DynaHack page was made in a rush for [ARRP 2013][arrp2013], using a stock [GitHub Pages][github-pages] theme, and as it turned out, those themes were not [Jekyll][jekyll]-ready, meaning that making a multiple-page site would involve a lot of copy-and-pasting, so I put off fixing the website for a long time; it's only now that I've gotten around to it.

As for DynaHack itself, development will resume at some point at my discretion.  If you're really eager, keep an eye on the [commit log][commits], which shows all code-related activity for the game.
