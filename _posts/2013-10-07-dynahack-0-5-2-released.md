[Download DynaHack 0.5.2](https://github.com/tung/DynaHack/releases/tag/v0.5.2)

Version 0.5.2 greatly increases save file integrity and ability to recover by fixing cases of incomplete data being logged that were overlooked by NitroHack and NetHack 4.  It is save-compatible with 0.5.0 and 0.5.1; *players of older versions are urged to update.*
