Thanks to the generosity of kerio, DynaHack can now be played online on the [`nethack.xd.cm`][nxc] public NetHack variant server.  Watch for DynaHack deaths, ascensions and discussion in the `#nethack.xd.cm` IRC channel on `freenode.net`!  Information about `nethack.xd.cm` across this website has been updated accordingly.

**<strike>If you want to play DynaHack with numpad controls and use PuTTY, you will need to disable "application keypad mode" in PuTTY's configuration; see the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/faq/#is-there-an-online-server-for-dynahack">DynaHack FAQ</a> for more details.</strike>**

**2015-08-17 update**: DynaHack should now work as-is with numpad and PuTTY.  Also, check out the new [nethack.xd.cm web terminal][web-term]!
