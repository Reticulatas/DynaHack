## Can DynaHack be played with graphical tiles?

No.  For a flavor of NetHack with a similar interface as DynaHack, consider trying [NetHack 4](http://nethack4.org).


## How do I make the font bigger?

DynaHack runs under the console program or terminal emulator provided by your operating system.  You can change the font by going into settings or preferences of that program, either in a menu or by right-clicking the window title bar or the window itself.


## How do I make dark blue brighter?

As with changing your font, open your console program or terminal emulator's settings or preferences, find the dark blue palette entry and adjust to taste.


## How do I play DynaHack if I'm on Linux or OS X?

Download the source code and compile it.

* [How to compile DynaHack on Linux](https://github.com/tung/DynaHack/blob/unnethack/doc/build-linux.md)
* [How to compile DynaHack on OS X](https://github.com/tung/DynaHack/blob/unnethack/doc/build-osx.md)

You can download the source code of either the [latest stable version]({{ site.download_url }}) (choose one of the "source code" links) or download the bleeding edge version directly from the [GitHub project page]({{ site.project_url }}).

If you use Windows and you're interested in the bleeding edge version, the game can also be compiled with [MinGW](https://github.com/tung/DynaHack/blob/unnethack/doc/build-mingw.md) (no strings attached), or under [Cygwin](https://github.com/tung/DynaHack/blob/unnethack/doc/build-mingw.md) (requires Cygwin to play) for those who prefer it.


## Is there an online server for DynaHack?

Despite the "connect to server" option in the main menu, I am not aware of any public online servers that offer DynaHack.

However, you can sometimes catch people streaming their DynaHack play live on [termcast.org](http://termcast.org).  You'll need to connect via `telnet termcast.org`; Windows users will need a telnet client such as [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).


## What is the font used in the screenshots on this site?

[GohuFont](http://font.gohu.org/).
