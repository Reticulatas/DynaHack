{"name":"Dynahack","tagline":"A NetHack variant with UnNetHack's new content/challenges, NitroHack's UI, GruntHack's random magical items, and more","body":"DynaHack\r\n========\r\n\r\nDynaHack is an experimental variant of NetHack.  It mainly merges the new\r\ncontent and challenges of UnNetHack (up to version 4.1.1) onto NitroHack as a\r\nbase, with its new resizable ASCII interface.  It also includes the save system,\r\nmany bug fixes and selected interface changes from NetHack4, magical equipment\r\nfrom GruntHack, and some original changes to add variety and fairness to the\r\ngameplay.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterface changes\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nDynaHack adopts NitroHack's interface, allowing it to make better use of larger\r\nterminal sizes, showing a multi-line message box and inventory sidebar.  Windows\r\nplayers will want to change the win_width and win_height options (resizing works\r\nautomatically on Linux and OS X).\r\n\r\nOptions in DynaHack are set in-game, unlike NetHack which uses a config file.\r\nThere are no means to import config files; instead, play some test games and\r\nchange options to taste.\r\n\r\nOther interface changes include:\r\n\r\n * Item action menus.\r\n * New and improved quick command reference (type '??').\r\n * Colored status area and HP/Pw bars.\r\n * Colors for walls and floors of branches and special rooms.\r\n * msgtype option to force \"--More--\" prompts and hide messages.\r\n * Menus for choosing floor items when eating and looting.\r\n\r\nSome interface changes provide more information than in NetHack:\r\n\r\n * Item weights and carrying capacity shown.\r\n * Red/green highlight when attributes change.\r\n * Highlighting for peacefuls, locked doors, item piles and covered stairs.\r\n * hp_notify option to show messages when damage is taken.\r\n * delay_msg option to show messages for multi-turn actions and delays.\r\n * Corpses show rotten/very rotten when unsafe to eat.\r\n * Required and remaining slots shown when viewing and enhancing skills.\r\n * Remaining memory for spells shown.\r\n\r\nSeveral changes have been made to make the game more convenient to play:\r\n\r\n * Ctrl-O shows dungeon overview and previous levels.\r\n * Ctrl-X shows intrinsic resistances and properties.\r\n * Ctrl-E engraves \"Elbereth\", which scares monsters.\r\n * Auto-unlock for doors/containers, auto-loot after auto-unlocking containers.\r\n * Resting and searching stop when HP/Pw fully recover.\r\n * 'ff' fires in the last direction fired in.\r\n\r\nFor those used to playing on NAO, automatic travel can target stairs even when\r\ncovered, stops when becoming hungry or enemies come into view, routes around\r\npeacefuls and even works in Sokoban.\r\n\r\nAutopickup is much smarter and more useful than in NetHack thanks to the\r\nautopickup rules system, offering fine-grained control over what it picks up or\r\nleaves.  It works much like autopickup exceptions, but can filter not only by\r\nname, but also item class and blessing/curses.  The default rules leave shop\r\nitems alone, but the sky's the limit in what it can do.  Autopickup also leaves\r\ndropped items alone, and grabs thrown/fired items.\r\n\r\nItem class filters are smarter: choosing \"cursed\" and \"armor\" will match only\r\ncursed armor, whereas in NetHack this would show all cursed items mixed with all\r\narmor.\r\n\r\nDynaHack features fully remappable controls, which is especially useful for\r\npeople with QWERTZ keyboards.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew content\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nDynaHack was originally a merge of UnNetHack's gameplay with NitroHack as its\r\nbase, so all of this new content sources from UnNetHack 4.1.1:\r\n\r\n * Over 80 new special levels.\r\n * Revamped Gehennom with special segments to explore and open caverns for a\r\n   faster and riskier descent.\r\n * New branches: Town, Black Market, Dragon Caves.\r\n * New special rooms: nymph gardens, dilapidated armories.\r\n * New shops: tin shops, instrument shops, pet stores.\r\n * New items: rings of gain intelligence/wisdom/dexterity, potions of blood and\r\n   vampire blood, scroll of flood, iron safe, tinfoil hat, striped shirt,\r\n   Thiefbane, Luck Blade.\r\n * New monsters: gold and chromatic dragons, snow ants, vorpal jabberwocks,\r\n   disintegrators, giant turtles, wax golems, locusts, enormous rats, rodents of\r\n   unusual size.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew challenges\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nLevel difficulty in DynaHack differs from NetHack.  The maximum level of\r\nmonsters that are generated on a level in NetHack is the average of the level's\r\ndepth and your experience level.  In DynaHack, only depth counts towards level\r\ndifficulty.  Experience levels tend to plateau, so overall level difficulty\r\nscales faster and higher than in NetHack.  This would seem to make the game\r\nharder, but the change also exists in NetHack4, which has been won by multiple\r\npeople, so the challenge is definitely surmountable.\r\n\r\nLike UnNetHack, wishing in DynaHack is divided into magical and non-magical\r\nitems.  Only the wand of wishing can grant wishes for magical items, while every\r\nother source can only provide non-magical items.  Examples of useful non-magical\r\nitems include the shield of reflection and dragon scales (but not dragon scale\r\nmail).  A magic lamp is permitted as an exception for non-magical wishes.\r\nUnlike in NetHack, wands of wishing cannot be recharged.\r\n\r\nDragons in DynaHack work much like in UnNetHack: names and colors are randomized\r\nevery game, so in one game a red dragon may be a tatzelworm and breathe ice, and\r\nin another it may be called a draken and breath disintegration.  This means\r\nwishing for dragon armor no longer gives a free ticket to reflection or magic\r\nresistance.  On top of this, dragon armor in general is heavier and provides\r\nless AC than in NetHack; dragon scale mail is 2/3 the weight and the same AC as\r\nelven mithril coats.\r\n\r\nDynaHack introduces color alchemy from UnNetHack, meaning that potions will mix\r\nby their colors instead of by their type, e.g. a red potion mixed with a yellow\r\npotion makes an orange potion.  In some games this leads to interesting\r\ncombinations, but this also breaks the NetHack practice of alchemizing large\r\nstacks of potions of full healing that could as much as double the max HP of\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nWith its roots in UnNetHack, DynaHack also adds these new challenges:\r\n\r\n * Elbereth is ignored by quest nemeses, unique demons and Vlad the Impaler.\r\n * Mysterious force removed (downward levelport while ascending through\r\n   Gehennom); Amulet now prevents all forms of teleportation.\r\n * Scrolls of gold detection can no longer be used to detect traps; crystal\r\n   balls have been made easier to use to compensate.\r\n * Scrolls of genocide only affect a single monster type when blessed, or the\r\n   same on only the current level when uncursed.\r\n * Fighting creates noise which wakes nearby monsters, depending on stealth and\r\n   the size of the weapon.\r\n * Unicorn horns no longer restore lost attributes.\r\n\r\nDynaHack addresses two common forms of farming in NetHack: pudding farming and\r\nthrone farming.  Both of these are still possible in limited forms, but as in\r\nUnNetHack, puddings no longer split forever, nor do they drop any items when\r\nkilled.  Thrones take time to loot and may disappear in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore fairness\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nDynaHack reduces the punishments for hazards players cannot or do not expect to\r\nhave to defend themselves against:\r\n\r\n * Warnings before walking into known traps, water and lava.\r\n * Poison, the most common unavoidable instadeath, instead drains max HP.\r\n * Floating eyes paralyze for half as long, capped further by wisdom.\r\n * Scroll of flood replaces the scroll of amnesia, making reading random scrolls\r\n   less game-ruining.\r\n\r\nDynaHack also reduces the spoiler advantage that long-time NetHack players have\r\nover novices by providing a newer and more informative database of item\r\ndescriptions from NetHack4 and detailed monster descriptions from UnNetHackPlus\r\n(press '/' and target a monster with ';' or enter its name).\r\n\r\n\r\nMore variety\r\n------------\r\n\r\nDynaHack features an extensively bug-fixed version of magical items from\r\nGruntHack.  Any weapon, armor, amulet or ring can appear as \"magical\", which may\r\ninflict or defend against fire or frost damage, drain life, grant stealth, speed\r\nor reflection, or even detonate on impact.  These magical properties encourage\r\nusing equipment that would otherwise be junk in NetHack; some equipment may even\r\nfill in essential ascension kit properties, freeing up equipment slots for\r\nalternate gear that would otherwise be displaced by ascension kit mainstays.\r\n\r\nWishes for magical properties can only be granted with a wand of wishing.  Even\r\nthen, such wishes only work for equipment that doesn't already have its own\r\nmagical properties, e.g. no speed boots of fire resistance.  However, no such\r\nrestriction applies to randomly generated items, so players are encouraged to\r\nexplore to find gear that may exceed what could be wished for.\r\n\r\nDynaHack encourages more weapon variety.  Weapons may reveal their enchantment\r\nwhen used, based on skill and race.  Weapon skills also cross-train,\r\naccelerating the training of related skills to allow players to experiment with\r\nskills early without having to fully commit to them into the late game.  The\r\nweapon skill groups are:\r\n\r\n * Short Blades: dagger, knife\r\n * Chopping Blades: axe, pick-axe\r\n * Swords: long sword, two-handed sword, scimitar, saber\r\n * Bludgeons: club, mace, hammer\r\n * Flails: whip\r\n * Polearms: polearm, trident, lance, unicorn horn\r\n * Launchers: bow, crossbow\r\n * Thrown: dart, shuriken, boomerang\r\n\r\nSome weapon skills (not listed above) belong to more than one group:\r\n\r\n * short sword: Short Blades, Swords\r\n * broadsword: Chopping Blades, Swords\r\n * morning star: Bludgeons, Flails\r\n * quarterstaff: Bludgeons, Polearms\r\n * javelin: Polearms, Thrown\r\n * sling: Launchers, Thrown\r\n\r\nDynaHack introduces the new heavyshot mechanic, complementing multishot.\r\nCertain fired or thrown weapons, rather than launching multiple volleys, will\r\ninstead launch a single volley that inflicts multiplied damage.  This makes\r\ncrossbows more interesting than heavier bows with rarer ammo, and also applies\r\nto shuriken, spears, javelins and boomerangs.  Spears of matching race and\r\njavelins receive a bonus multiplier when thrown.\r\n\r\nRanged combat is enhanced in DynaHack.  Items, especially ammo, stacks much more\r\nreadily than in NetHack, ignoring differing knowledge of blessing and\r\nenchantment.  Further, switching main and alternate weapons using 'x' no longer\r\ncosts a turn, making launchers more viable.\r\n\r\nDynaHack makes two-handed weapons viable throughout the game:\r\n\r\n * Polearms and lances can be used in melee, making them easier to train early\r\n   and usable in dark corridors.\r\n * Two-handed weapons double the strength damage bonus on hits.\r\n * New #tip command for containers, so players with hands stuck to a cursed\r\n   two-handed weapon can still reach their holy water without having to\r\n   backtrack out of Gehennom.\r\n * Hands stuck to a cursed quarterstaff can still cast spells unhindered.\r\n\r\nDynaHack attempts to differentiate characters of different roles by improving\r\ntheir quest artifact.  Specifically, the quest artifact cannot be stolen by the\r\nWizard of Yendor, making it a reliable source of resistances.  Also, the quest\r\nartifact grants magic resistance when carried by their role, giving most\r\ncharacters a good reason to make use of their unique powers.\r\n\r\nDynaHack reduces incentives to stash and backtrack:\r\n\r\n * Scrolls of ID work on 3-6 items regardless of their blessing.\r\n * Wraiths can no longer be lured across levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompiling from source\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nDynaHack can be compiled to run natively in Windows with\r\n[MinGW](doc/build-mingw.md), or under [Cygwin](doc/build-cygwin.md) for those\r\nwho prefer it.\r\n\r\nDynaHack can also be compiled for [Linux](doc/build-linux.md) and [OS\r\nX](doc/build-osx.md).\r\n\r\n\r\nBug reports\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nBug reports should include a description (what you did, what you expected and\r\nwhat happened), as well as the specific version of the game and a copy of the\r\nsave file if possible.\r\n\r\nBug reports can be submitted to the GitHub project page at:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/tung/DynaHack\r\n\r\nOr they can be emailed to tungtn3+dynahack@gmail.com.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
